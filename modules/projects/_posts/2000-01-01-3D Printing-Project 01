title: 3D Printing Project 01 - Print something functional
---

## **Overview:**
- **Objective:**
  - Introduce participants to the 3D printing process by downloading and printing a functional object.
- **Key Components:**
  - Basic understanding of 3D printing.
  - Choosing and downloading a 3D model.
  - Hands-on experience with a 3D printer.
  - Post-printing steps.

## **Inspiration:**
- **Functional Object Options:**
  - Keychains, phone stands, cable organizers, etc.
  - Browse online platforms like [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) for a wide range of pre-designed functional objects.
- **Customization Ideas:**
  - Colors, sizes, and minor modifications to personalize the chosen design.

## **Activities/Workflow:**
1. **Choosing an Object:**
   - Participants select a functional object from the provided list or propose their own ideas.
2. **Downloading the Design:**
   - Visit platforms like [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) and download the chosen 3D model.
3. **Preparing for Printing:**
   - Learn basic considerations such as sizing, infill, and layer resolution.
4. **Hands-On Printing:**
   - Observe the 3D printer in action and gain insight into the printing process.
5. **Post-Processing:**
   - Briefly cover post-processing steps, including removing supports and adding finishing touches.

## **Reflect and Share:**
- **Group Discussion:**
  - Reflect on the experience. What did you learn? What challenges did you face?
  - Share thoughts on the chosen functional object and the 3D printing process.

## **Taking Your Project to the Next Level:**
- **Experimentation:**
  - Encourage participants to experiment with different colors, sizes, or modifications for a unique touch.
  - Combine multiple 3D-printed parts to create more complex structures.

## **Further Learning:**
- **Advanced Techniques:**
  - Explore advanced 3D printing techniques such as dual extrusion, multi-material printing, or complex geometries.
  - Learn about designing original 3D models using software like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/), or [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).
