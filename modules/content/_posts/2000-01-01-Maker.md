## Introduction
  "Welcome to our exciting journey into the world of Maker Space! Today marks the beginning of a hands-on exploration where creativity knows no bounds. In this class, we will dive into the fascinating realm of Maker Spaces, learning about the various tools at our disposal and unleashing our creativity by crafting something meaningful from a simple yet versatile materialâ€”cardboard.

  Maker Spaces are collaborative environments where ideas come to life. They are equipped with an array of tools and materials that empower individuals to design, build, and innovate. Today, we will take our first steps in understanding these tools and putting our newfound knowledge to use by creating something practical out of cardboard.

  Now, let's set the stage for an exciting journey of discovery and creation as we embark on this Maker Space adventure!"

## Project
  -Make something useful with Cardboard [Cardboard Challenge](https://cardboard-challenge.com/)

  **Understand Cardboard Properties:** Begin by understanding the properties of cardboard. Recognize its strengths, weaknesses, and flexibility. This understanding will guide design choices.
  **Brainstorm Ideas:** Encourage students to brainstorm ideas for practical items they can create with cardboard. Consider everyday problems that can be solved or needs that can be addressed.
  **Plan and Sketch:** Before cutting or assembling, have students plan and sketch their designs. This helps visualize the final product and consider structural elements.
  **Measure Twice, Cut Once:** Emphasize the importance of accurate measurements. Remind students to measure twice before making cuts to ensure precision and avoid wastage.
  **Utilize Templates:** Provide or encourage the use of templates for complex shapes or structures. Templates can be a helpful starting point and ensure consistency in design.
  **Explore Joining Techniques:** Teach various joining techniques such as tabs, flaps, and folds to connect pieces of cardboard securely. Experiment with different methods based on the project requirements.
  **Layering for Strength:** When appropriate, consider layering cardboard to increase strength. Gluing layers together can create a sturdier structure for certain projects.
  **Incorporate Fasteners:** Introduce students to the use of fasteners like brads, paper clips, or even glue guns for securing pieces together. Discuss the pros and cons of each method.
  **Test and Iterate:** Encourage a culture of testing and iteration. Have students test their creations and be open to making adjustments for improved functionality.
  **Think Beyond Flat Surfaces:** Challenge students to think beyond flat surfaces. Explore ways to create curves, angles, and 3D structures using cardboard.
  **Consider Aesthetics:** While the primary focus is on functionality, discuss the aesthetics of the final product. Encourage students to consider color, patterns, and visual appeal.
  **Reuse and Recycle:** Emphasize the sustainability aspect of cardboard. Encourage students to use recycled cardboard and consider the environmental impact of their creations.
  **Collaborate and Share Ideas:** Foster a collaborative environment where students can share ideas, seek feedback, and learn from one another's experiences. Collaboration often leads to innovative solutions.
  **Document the Process:** Have students document their design and construction process. This can include photos, sketches, and written reflections. Documenting the journey enhances the learning experience.
  **Celebrate Creativity:** Lastly, celebrate creativity and the unique solutions students come up with. Encourage them to take pride in their creations and share their work with the class.
